### Thought Process and notes

0. Learn to play Mindsweeper
1. Get environment up, check for dependencies
2. Review assignment (README.md)
2. Review code: (understand the parameters, discover what's already coded)
3. Make a "Plan of Attack"

### Plan of Attack

1. âœ… Display complete grid with hidden bombs
  - Starter code only renders a single cell. Start by adding rows & columns.
2. ðŸ”¥ Click events > reveal bombs or empty
3. Check Surrounding cells: logic first (Populate object)
4. Add recursive Check: logic first (Populate object)
5. Add to UI
6. Test
7. Refactor
8. Review and add notes

### Time tracker

1. download code and review (10 min.)

### Why I added ComponentWillMount

* I wanted to add a mine counter to the game.
* However, I couldn't set the state of another field before the component had been mounted.
* So, having one field dependent on another, required the component to be mounted to add the additional state variable to the game instance.

### Why I added componentDidUpdate

* Edge case handler: When the final cells are populated recursivily the state isn't updated until after logic. Therefore, it doesn't trigger that you've WON.
* So, by tying the winner event in the componentDidUpdate life-cycle, we can wait until the component updates to check for winners.

### Feature Enhancements (Ideas)
